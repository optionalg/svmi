Because google was unable to block spambots from googlecode, and also just got tired of their promise to create googlecode to help 'pay back their debt to the free software community', I've had to move rbxi source repos to [sgfxi github](https://github.com/smxi/sgfxi). This is a drag, because I can't stand github, or git, but it's the easiest option for me, and also github is the most likely to attract eyeballs to rbxi, which is a fine backup utility that I have relied on for many years on all my systems, and the few client systems I still maintain as well. Never a flaw, never a failure, that's good enough for me, and I hope it's good enough for some other people too.

svmi was created as a module for smxi, but it seems more appropriate to house it in its own svn directory.

svmi is a script for easy, user friendly installation and maintenance of virtualbox and vmware components on your debian system

You can get more information at the [smxi svn](http://code.google.com/p/smxi) or at the [project forums](http://techpatterns.com/forums/forum-33.html), where you can also post questions and read about updates and other things.

There is also basic [script documentation](http://techpatterns.com/docs/), which tells you how to do some other things with options and so on.
